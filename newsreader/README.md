### Configuring the ApiKey

1. Navigate to ./src/config/ there you will find a file called configExample.js
2. Make a copy of that file and name it config.js
3. Open the file and where it says "changeThisToYourApiKeyHere", change it to your key.
   For example your config.js file should look something like: export const ApiKey = "7f8dhs8bsdgbsknefkfekakef";

### installing packages

1. Now that you have the key configured you need to install all the needed dependencies
2. run "npm install" in the root folder(newsreader/) and wait for npm to do all the work

### run the app

1. now you are ready to run the app
2. run "npm start" in the root folder and enjoy
